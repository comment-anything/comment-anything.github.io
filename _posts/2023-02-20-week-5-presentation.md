## Devlog Videos

This week, I created a few videos documenting my coding process.

### ExtractPath video

The first video is the implementation of "ExtractPath" which extracts a domain and sub-path from a url string. I struggled with Golangs regex library for a little while, but I got it in the end.

### Initialize Page, Get Comments video

The second video is code to initialize a Page object and populate it with comments from the database. I had to think about how to transform database rows into Server-Client communication entities.

{% include video.html content="2022-02-17-Initializepage.mp4" %}

### New Comments video

The third video is the implementation of the newComment pipeline, which allows a user to post a new comment.
